## üîß Environment Variables Configuration

To ensure all features work correctly, you need to configure the following environment variables:

### Brevo API (Newsletter)

To connect the newsletter form to Brevo:

```bash
# Brevo API key for newsletter subscriptions
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key
```

#### How to obtain a Brevo API key
1. Log in to your Brevo account
2. Go to SMTP & API > API Keys > Generate a new API key
3. Copy the generated key

#### Configuration on Netlify
1. Go to Netlify dashboard > Site > Settings > Environment variables
2. Add a variable named `BREVO_API_KEY` with your Brevo API key

> **Important note**: With this configuration, you do **NOT** need n8n. The integrated API sends data directly to Brevo.

### n8n Variables (OPTIONAL)

n8n is a workflow automation tool that supports HTTP requests and can be used as an intermediary for form processing. While the direct Brevo API integration is simpler and recommended, you may choose to use n8n for more complex automation workflows:

```bash
# n8n webhook URL for forms
PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/...
```

#### Configuration on Netlify
1. Go to Netlify dashboard > Site > Settings > Environment variables
2. Add a variable named `PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` with your n8n webhook URL

### Local Development Variables

For local development, create a `.env` file at the project root with the necessary variables:

```bash
# Brevo API key (recommended)
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key

# n8n webhook URL (optional - not recommended)
PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/...
```

**Important**: Make sure the `.env` file is included in your `.gitignore` to avoid exposing your API keys.
