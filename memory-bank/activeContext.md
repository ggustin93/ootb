## Current Primary Focus: Finalizing and Merging Anchor Link Scrolling Fix (`trailingSlash: true`)

### 1. Background & Problem Statement:
- The Astro configuration `trailingSlash: true` (in `src/config.yaml`) is active for URL consistency with Netlify's `pretty_urls = true` and to prevent previous GSC 5xx errors.
- This setup interfered with native anchor scrolling, especially for subsequent anchor navigations on the same page.
- Initial navigation links in `src/content/navigation/index.json` also lacked trailing slashes before hashes, causing local 404s.

### 2. Goals:
- Restore smooth, reliable automatic scrolling to anchor targets.
- Maintain `trailingSlash: true`.
- Ensure correct navigation link behavior in local dev and production.
- Account for the sticky header.

### 3. Solution Implemented:
A multi-part solution has been implemented and verified on the `staging` branch:

   **a) Client-Side JavaScript for Anchor Scrolling (`src/components/common/BasicScripts.astro`):**
    - A `handleAnchorScroll()` JavaScript function was added.
    - This function is called on page load (`onLoad` which is triggered by `window.onload` and `astro:after-swap`) **and also via a `window.addEventListener('hashchange', handleAnchorScroll)` listener** to handle same-page anchor navigations.
    - It reads `window.location.hash`.
    - **Key Logic**: It cleans the hash by removing any trailing slash (e.g., `#myanchor/` becomes `myanchor`) before `document.getElementById()`.
    - It calculates the correct scroll position, accounting for the sticky header's `offsetHeight`.
    - It uses `window.scrollTo()` with `behavior: 'smooth'`.
    - Debugging `console.log` statements have been commented out after successful testing.

   **b) Update Navigation Links (`src/content/navigation/index.json`):**
    - All internal navigation links pointing to anchors were updated to include a trailing slash in the path segment before the hash (e.g., `"/festival/#programme"`).

   **c) Astro Configuration (`src/config.yaml`):**
    - `trailingSlash: true` remains active.

### 4. Recent Changes & Current Status:
- **`src/components/common/BasicScripts.astro`**: Modified as described above. All anchor scrolling scenarios, including same-page subsequent anchor clicks, are confirmed working on the `staging` Netlify deployment. Console logs have been commented out.
- **`src/content/navigation/index.json`**: `href` values updated.
- **`staging` Branch Commit (d1a4263)**: This commit, intended to remove console logs, also included other pending changes:
    - Deletion of `.cursorrules`.
    - Modifications to `.gitignore`, `package-lock.json`, `package.json`.
    - Updates to festival content files (`src/content/festival/*` and `src/content/festival/raw-data/*`).
- **Local & Staging Testing**: Confirmed that:
    - Clicking menu links navigates correctly.
    - No 404 errors related to these links.
    - Anchor scrolling works reliably in all tested scenarios on `staging`.
- **File `src/services/api/nocodb/`**: Remains untracked.

### 5. Next Steps:
1.  **Review and Confirm Changes in Commit `d1a4263`**: Ensure all files included in this commit on the `staging` branch (beyond the `BasicScripts.astro` log cleanup) are intended and ready for merging to `main`.
2.  **Merge `staging` Branch to `main`**: Once confirmed, merge the `staging` branch into the `main` production branch.
3.  **Deploy `main` to Production**: Netlify will automatically deploy `main`.
4.  **Post-Production Testing**: Perform a final round of testing on the live production site.
5.  **Monitor Production**: Monitor site behavior and Google Search Console for any new issues.
6.  **Handle Untracked/Remaining Files**:
    - Decide the fate of the untracked `src/services/api/nocodb/` directory (e.g., add to `.gitignore` if not yet ready, or commit to a feature branch like `feature/nocodb-refactoring`).
    - Address any other outstanding local changes not part of the `staging` branch.
7.  **(Future Task - Deferred)** Revisit the renaming of `id="features"` on `/festival/`.
8.  **Update `memory-bank/progress.md`** to reflect the completion of this task.

### 6. Active Decisions & Considerations:
- The combined client-side script enhancements and navigation link updates have successfully resolved anchor scrolling issues while maintaining SEO best practices for URL structure.
- The `staging` branch now contains a mix of the anchor fix and other site updates; these will be merged to `main` together unless a different strategy is decided before merging.

## Developer Brief: Fixing Anchor Link Scrolling with Trailing Slashes in Astro
<!-- Retained for technical reference on the implemented solution -->
### 1. Problem Statement:
Our Astro website, with `trailingSlash: true`, had issues with in-page anchor link navigation, especially for subsequent clicks on the same page. The browser often wouldn't scroll to the target section.

### 2. Goal:
Restore reliable automatic scrolling to anchor targets, accounting for the sticky header and maintaining `trailingSlash: true`.

### 3. Reasoning & Chosen Approach:
- **Native Browser Behavior Interruption**: `trailingSlash: true` and client-side effects can disrupt default scroll-to-hash.
- **Client-Side JavaScript Solution**: A script in `src/components/common/BasicScripts.astro` handles scrolling explicitly.
- **Lifecycle Events**: Uses `window.onload`, `astro:after-swap` (via `onLoad` function), and importantly, `window.addEventListener('hashchange', handleAnchorScroll)`.
- **Sticky Header Consideration**: Calculates header height for correct scroll offset.
- **Hash Cleaning**: Removes potential trailing slashes from `window.location.hash` before fetching elements.

### 4. Action Plan (Implemented):
- **Defined `handleAnchorScroll()` function**:
    - Reads `window.location.hash`.
    - Cleans hash (e.g., `#anchor/` to `anchor`).
    - Finds element by ID.
    - Calculates offset for sticky header.
    - Scrolls using `window.scrollTo({ behavior: 'smooth' })`.
- **Called `handleAnchorScroll()`**:
    - From the existing `onLoad` function (triggered by `window.onload` and `astro:after-swap`).
    - From a new `window.addEventListener('hashchange', handleAnchorScroll)`.
- **Navigation Links Updated**: Ensured `href` attributes in `src/content/navigation/index.json` have trailing slashes before anchors (e.g. `/path/#anchor`).

### 5. Testing Steps (Completed on Staging):
- Direct anchor URLs load and scroll correctly.
- In-page menu links to anchors work on initial click.
- **Subsequent in-page menu clicks to different anchors now also work correctly due to the `hashchange` listener.**
- Cross-page links with anchors work.
- Header offset is correctly handled.
